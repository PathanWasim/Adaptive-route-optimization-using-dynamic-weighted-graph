"""
Adaptive Disaster Evacuation Route Optimization System

A graph-based pathfinding application that demonstrates advanced algorithmic concepts
for Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. The system models urban environments
as dynamic weighted graphs and computes optimal evacuation routes during disasters
using Dijkstra's algorithm with priority queue optimization.
