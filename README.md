# Adaptive Disaster Evacuation Route Optimization System

A graph-based pathfinding application that demonstrates advanced algorithmic concepts for a Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. The system models urban environments as dynamic weighted graphs and computes optimal evacuation routes during disasters using Dijkstra's algorithm with priority queue optimization.

## Project Overview

Traditional navigation systems compute routes based on shortest distance, but during disasters such as floods, fires, or earthquakes, the shortest route may not be safe. This project implements an adaptive evacuation routing system that computes the safest and most time-efficient evacuation path by modeling real cities as dynamic weighted graphs using OpenStreetMap data.

## Key Features

- **Real-World Road Networks**: Integration with OpenStreetMap for authentic city road networks
- **Interactive Web Application**: Professional web interface with Leaflet.js map visualization
- **Algorithm Visualization**: Step-by-step animation of Dijkstra's algorithm execution
- **Dynamic Graph Modeling**: Cities represented as weighted graphs G(V, E) with dynamic edge weights
- **Disaster Simulation**: Support for three disaster types (Fire, Flood, Earthquake) with different risk models
- **Optimal Pathfinding**: Dijkstra's algorithm implementation with O(E log V) complexity
- **Comparative Analysis**: Real-time comparison of normal vs disaster-aware routing
- **Academic Rigor**: Formal correctness proofs and comprehensive property-based testing

## Available Cities

The system includes pre-configured cities optimized for fast loading:

**United States:**
- Piedmont, California
- Berkeley, California
- Albany, California

**India:**
- Pune - Shivajinagar
- Pune - Koregaon Park
- Mumbai - Bandra West
- Bangalore - Indiranagar
- Delhi - Connaught Place

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd disaster-evacuation-routing
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_web.txt
```

3. Install the package in development mode:
```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Web Application (Recommended)

Run the interactive web application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

**Features:**
- Select from pre-configured cities
- Click on map to select source and destination
- Configure disaster scenarios (fire, flood, earthquake)
- Watch Dijkstra's algorithm execute step-by-step
- Compare normal vs disaster-aware routes in real-time

### Command Line Demo

Run the demonstration script:

```bash
python demo.py
```

This loads a real city network, applies a disaster, and computes evacuation routes.

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from disaster_evacuation import GraphManager, DisasterModel, PathfinderEngine
from disaster_evacuation.osm import OSMExtractor, GraphConverter

# Extract real road network
extractor = OSMExtractor()
osm_graph = extractor.extract_by_place("Piedmont, California, USA")

# Convert to internal format
converter = GraphConverter()
graph, coords = converter.convert_osm_to_internal(osm_graph)

# Apply disaster effects
from disaster_evacuation.disaster import DisasterModeler
modeler = DisasterModeler(graph, coords)
modeler.apply_fire((37.8244, -122.2312), radius=200.0)

# Find optimal evacuation route
pathfinder = PathfinderEngine()
result = pathfinder.find_shortest_path(graph, "0", "50")
print(result.get_path_summary())
```

## Testing

The project uses comprehensive testing with both unit tests and property-based tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=disaster_evacuation

# Run property-based tests only
pytest -k "property"

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_pathfinder_engine.py
```

**Test Coverage:**
- 54 unit tests covering core functionality
- 15 property-based tests for algorithmic correctness
- Integration tests for OSM data pipeline
- Visualization and web API tests

## Academic Integrity

- OpenStreetMap provides road network data structure only
- No routing functionality from OSM libraries

✅ **Complete implementation transparency**
- Full source code available for review
- Comprehensive test suite validates correctness
- Algorithm execution can be visualized step-by-step
